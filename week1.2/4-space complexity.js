// SPACE COMPLEXITY
// We can use big O notation to analyze space complexity:
//  how much additional memory do we need to allocate in order to run the code in our algorithm?

// * Most primitives(booleans,numbers,undefined,null) are constant space
//  * Strings require O(n) space ( Where n is the string length)
//  * Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length(for arrays) or the number of keys(for objects)


// To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation.
// Big O notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm.
// Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends(linear?quadratic?constant?)
// The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
// Big O Notation is everywhere, so get lots of practice
