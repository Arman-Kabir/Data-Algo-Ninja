// PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACH
/** ***** 1.understanding the problem
 * restate the problem in own words
 * what are the inputs and outputs
 * is there enough information to solve the problem
 * thinking of labelling data(don't use random label like i,j,k,a,b)
 * checking the example with invalid, empty input
 * 
 * *****2. Not down the details like input,output,outcome
 * 
 * *****3. Start with naive/brute force approach. First thing that comes into mind. It shows that u'r able to think well and 
 * critically (you don't need to write this code,just speak about it)
 *  
 * 
 * *****4. Tell them why this approach is not the best
 * 
 * *****5. Walk through your approach, comment things and see where you may be able to break things
 * 
 * *****6. Before you start coding, walk through your code and write down the steps you are going to follow
 * 
 * *****7. breakdown the steps and comment is the ultimate key, rundown of thinking process,steps.
 *  Breaking down the code will give you the extra advantage
 *  
 * 
 * *****8. start coding. (simplify as necessary)
